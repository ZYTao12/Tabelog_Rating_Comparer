# Ethics Statement

## Web Scraping Practices

This project involves web scraping to collect data from Tabelog.com. We are committed to ethical data collection practices and adhere to the following principles:

1. **Respect for robots.txt**: Our web scraping practices strictly adhere to the guidelines set forth in the robots.txt file of the target website (Tabelog.com). We have carefully reviewed the robots.txt file and ensure that our scraping activities do not violate any directives specified therein.

2. **Rate Limiting**: To prevent overwhelming the server and to be a good netizen, we implement rate limiting in our scraping code. This ensures that we do not send too many requests in a short period.

3. **Data Usage**: The data collected is used for non-commercial, research purposes only. We do not republish or redistribute the scraped data in its raw form.

4. **Minimal Impact**: Our scraping code is designed to have minimal impact on the target website's performance. We only collect the data that is necessary for our analysis.

5. **Transparency**: We are open about our data collection methods and are willing to cease our activities if requested by the website owners.

6. **Privacy**: We do not collect any personal or sensitive information during our scraping process.

By adhering to these principles, we believe that our web scraping practices are ethical and do not violate the terms of service or the robots.txt directives of Tabelog.com.

## Responsible Use of APIs

In addition to web scraping, this project also uses the Google Places API. We ensure that our use of this API is in compliance with Google's terms of service and usage policies.

We are committed to reviewing and updating our practices regularly to ensure continued ethical compliance in our data collection and analysis processes.
